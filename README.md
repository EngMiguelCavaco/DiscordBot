# DiscordBot

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

In this project you’ll use Node to build a Discord Bot that will predict the weather, forecast astronomical information, and act as a sandbox to practice everything related to Node and backend programming.

﻿You’ll apply your Node.js skills to build a backend application that integrates with two sets of professionally built APIs: the Discord APIs and the Weather API. We’ll cover Node.js best practices, how to work with APIs (including both REST and WebSockets) and we’ll even touch on one or two security related topics. 

One of the questions I'm asked most often by Node.js developers is: What's the best way to practice my backend skills without getting bogged down in the frontend? The beauty of this project is that the front end to our project already exists – it’s the widely used Discord application. Your bot will be usable by all of Discord’s hundreds of millions of existing users on desktop, web, and mobile. One of those users could be your future employer!

WHAT TOOLS WILL BE USED?

Node.js, Discord.js, Weather API, axios
